 // change of plans, its just gonna be tic tac toe with some spice
 // did my fair bit of research in order to achieve my goal

used a for-loop for the main game logic
a few functions and elements
event listeners
strings and arrays

made the board on photoshop, nothing to crazy.

i originally wanted to do something special but i guess ill keep it simple.

i wanted to use PNG files for the X and O but i couldn't figure that out. def something
id like to come back to and add.

i wanna add power ups to give the player a winning chance, maybe erase a used square or something.
i want to add a status bar of current wins and loses. Choose your color, maybe use a different board or even a bigger board.

the approach i took was a simple one, i used my old connect four project to make this happen but i also needed some help so google helped a lot.
i had some bumps on the way (how to set up the cells )
